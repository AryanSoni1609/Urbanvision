Here’s a **clean, professional, college-project-friendly README** — same meaning, better tone:

# **UrbanVision – Vehicle Detection and Counting**

This project implements a vehicle detection and counting system using **OpenCV** in **Python**. The goal is to analyze video streams and automatically identify moving vehicles, estimate traffic flow, and provide useful insights for monitoring and analysis.

The system applies classical computer vision techniques to detect moving objects, draw bounding boxes around vehicles, and count them as they pass through a defined region in the video frame.

## **Applications**

This project can be applied in several real-world scenarios, including:

* **Traffic Monitoring:**
  The system can be used to observe traffic conditions in real time and estimate the number of vehicles passing through a road segment.

* **Environmental Monitoring:**
  By analyzing traffic density, the system can help in studying vehicle usage patterns that contribute to air pollution and congestion.

## **Technologies Used**

The project is built using:

* **Python** for program logic and data processing
* **OpenCV** for image processing, motion detection, object localization, and visualization

OpenCV is a widely used, open-source computer vision library that provides efficient tools for video processing and real-time image analysis, making it well suited for this application.
